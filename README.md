# Vida Fontend Code Challenge

Hey there and welcome to VIDAs code challenge :)

**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY** 👀

To get startet, you first need to **help us get the app running again**,  
because right now **we have two bugs** 🐞 that prevent a successful build 😔

So clone this repo and try `ng serve`, so you will see yourself...

Have fun :)

**NOTE**

We are using Angular 15, which requires Node version "^14.20.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.10.0".  
You can use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to temporary change your Node version.
```
## NVM setup
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
## or
$ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash

## NVM usage
$ nvm install v14.20.0
$ nvm use v14.20.0
```
